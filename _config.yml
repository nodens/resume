          While this was mainly a cursus in humanities, I spent a lot - most - of my free time
          teaching myself how to use a computer and Internet, discovered the concept
          of FOSS, installed my first Linux distribution, and spent probably too much
          time trying to make a high-end soundcard work with it - or on IRC on
          FOSS oriented channels.

      Alongside my interests in open source, infrastructure and engineering, I'm also an avid reader, and enjoy performing arts and music (almost all genres). Also, if I have to go somewhere - or nowhere - I prefer doing it walking or riding a motorbike.
